# CodSoft Internship Java Projects

Welcome to my CodSoft Internship repository! This repository contains five Java projects I completed as part of the internship program. These projects demonstrate my skills in Java programming.

## Projects

### 1. ATM Interface

The ATM Interface project simulates an ATM machine, allowing users to check balances, withdraw funds, and make deposits.

### 2. Quiz Game

The Quiz Game is an interactive Java console application that quizzes users on a variety of topics. It keeps track of scores and provides feedback.

### 3. Number Game

In the Number Game project, I created a number guessing game. Players have to guess the correct number within a specified range, and the program provides hints.

### 4. Student Registration System

The Student Registration System is a Java program that manages student information. It can add, update, and delete student records, as well as display student details.

### 5. Grade Calculator

The Grade Calculator project helps calculate student grades based on assignments, exams, and other criteria. It provides final grades and can store multiple student records.
